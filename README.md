# Word to Excel Extractor

This project extracts **tables from Microsoft Word (`.docx`) files** and saves them into a clean Excel (`.xlsx`) file.  
It is useful for working with government reports, financial tables, or any document that contains structured data.

- It only extracts tables. If your Word file has paragraphs, titles, or sections outside of tables, they will be ignored.

- If a document is purely text (no tables), the result will be an empty Excel.
